# The 3D court camera: keypoint PnP seed → paint fit → tracked pose

**2026-09-17, one session (task brief: "upgrade court spatial modeling from 2D homography to an
adaptive 3D PnP & keypoint calibration").** Branch `camera3d-pnp-paintfit`.

Code:
- `backend/swingvision/camera3d.py`: `CourtCamera`, `solve_pnp_seed`, `fit_camera_on_paint`;
- `backend/swingvision/paintfit.py`: the R1 fit, lifted from CP1;
- `backend/swingvision/camtrack.py`: `CameraTracker`;
- `courtfit.KeypointSet` / `KeypointDetector` / `CourtNetKeypoints` / `ClassicalKeypoints` /
  `cross_ratio_check`;
- `court.LANDMARKS_3D` / `KEYPOINTS_3D` / `COLLINEAR_SETS`;
- `setup_state` `camera` block.

Tools: `tools/court_camera3d_seed.py` (arms K, K0) and `tools/court_track_sim.py` (tracking).

**WHAT EVERY SCORED NUMBER HERE IS MEASURED AGAINST:** the exact synthetic camera that rendered the
image. That means true ground coordinates of 11 points on each of C1's 14 line halves, projected
through that camera, with the error taken perpendicular to each line (as in C1 and CP1). No labels,
no model output, no footage.

**Rule 5.** Every camera states what pinned it (`CourtCamera.pinned_by`). The keypoint PnP camera is
pinned by detected points, the regulation court and a centred principal point. The paint-fit camera
is pinned by what CP1 lists. A reprojection residual is reported as a diagnostic and never used as
evidence.

**Scope decisions (user, this session):**
- **court only**: the brief's ball-trajectory solver was dropped, since ball work is archived;
- **keypoints only seed**: C1 measured that point-pinned cameras misplace far lines by metres; the
  paint fit decides the camera;
- **detector = interface + adapters**: no model trained here.

## PRE-REGISTRATION — written and committed before any scored run

### G1. Arm K — the paint fit seeded by keypoints through PnP

**Scene:** CP1 arm P, unchanged:
- Brown lens, fence and truss clutter, sensor noise;
- 30-frame mean through real libx265;
- 1920×1080, 3 m mount, 100° horizontal FOV.

**Seed:**
- every `court.LANDMARKS_3D` keypoint that projects into the frame;
- per-axis Gaussian noise σ = 14.78 px (CP1's seed noise);
- TWO gross outliers per trial, 100–300 px in a random direction;
- through `camera3d.solve_pnp_seed`, with no focal length given. The cross-ratio gate is on.

**Fit:** `paintfit.r1_fit` from that seed.
- The principal point is the image centre. This fixes the latent leak qa found in CP1, which passed
  the true `cx`.
- n = 400, `--seed 0`, CP1's readouts M and L.
- A trial that throws (PnP refused, fit failed) is a failure scored as infinite error.

**BAR (the SPEC §3 working target, not a founder bar):**
- **PASS** if every line's p90 of max(M, L) ≤ **5 cm**;
- **KILL** if any line > **10 cm**;
- otherwise INDETERMINATE.

**Prediction:** PASS, with the far baseline near CP1 arm P's 3.58 cm (L), because the seed is no
worse than CP1's. Risks:
- the PnP focal error (a smoke run on another seed showed 7% p90) is larger than CP1's
  four-corner seed;
- outliers that RANSAC keeps.

### G2. Arm K0 — the keypoint camera alone (no paint fit)

The same seeds, scored with readout M only. **Reported, no gate.**

**Prediction, from C1:** KILL on the far lines, by tens of centimetres to metres. This arm exists to
show why the paint fit decides.

### G3. Tracking — `camtrack.CameraTracker` under fence sway and a knock

**Setup, `tools/court_track_sim.py`:**
- **Render:** 1920×1080, 30 fps, 120 frames per seed, **seeds 0, 1, 2 pooled** (360 frames).
- **Sway:** fence sway of ~0.3° (yaw, pitch) and 0.15° roll, as sinusoids plus a random walk, with
  ~1 cm translation.
- **Knock:** at 2.0 s, +1.5° pitch and +1° yaw, held.
- **Setup on frame 0 as the product would do it:** noisy keypoints (σ 14.78 px) → PnP seed → paint
  fit.
- **Renderer:** simpler than CP1's. Flat court, 5 cm paint, 2×2 supersampling, 0.9 px blur, sensor
  noise, and a far fence with posts. No lens and no codec.
- **Tracker settings:** `TrackConfig()` defaults, all unmeasured, as SPEC §1 says.

**BAR, camtrack:**
- **PASS** if every line's p90 over all 360 frames ≤ **5 cm**, AND
  - the largest frame-to-frame far-baseline jump beyond the true motion is ≤ **2 px**, outside the
    6 frames starting at each knock, AND
  - after each knock every line is back within 5 cm within **15 frames** (0.5 s).
- **KILL** if any line's p90 > **10 cm**, or any knock never recovers.
- Otherwise INDETERMINATE.

**Baseline, `calibration.court_lock_step`** (the shipped per-frame snap, same frames and the same
starting court): **reported, no gate.**

**Prediction:** its own docstring says it "does NOT track a sustained pan", and its bounds are 14 px
and 1.2°. It should hold during sway, lose the court at the knock, and never come back, so KILL.

### G4. Already fixed BEFORE this pre-registration (development numbers, not scored results)

- **The cross-ratio gate tolerance** was set on a NOISE-ONLY simulation: CP1's σ 14.78 px on
  exact keypoints, three camera poses, 300 draws each. The results, as the rate of any false flag,
  then the rate of catching a near point moved 1.5 m:

  | Tolerance (px @720) | False flags | Moved point caught |
  |---|---|---|
  | 20 | 18–38% | — |
  | 40 | 6–12% | — |
  | 60 | 0.3% | 87–90% |

  **Chosen: 60 px @720**, scaled by frame height. Predicting a point from other noisy points
  amplifies their noise, so this gate only ever catches gross errors, and RANSAC does the real
  outlier work. With the 10% relative cross-ratio tolerance first written, a 1 m move changed the
  ratio by only 5–8% and passed; that version was discarded.
- **Two tracker faults found on the unit tests (`test_camtrack.py`), not on the scored sim:**
  - LK flow from frame to frame DRIFTED, about 0.7 px per frame on a slow pan. The optimiser
    converged below the true pose's cost, so the drift was the measurement having no anchor. Flow now
    only predicts, and each point is snapped onto the paint ridge along its line's normal.
  - Samples placed on ITF line EDGES instead of paint centres, and samples at line crossings, biased
    the snap by about 4 px. They now sample paint centrelines, at least 0.3 m from any other line.

  After both fixes a 30-frame pan tracks to within 0.1–0.2 px after a 5-frame filter catch-up.

## Rule 7 — lifting the R1 fit into `swingvision.paintfit` changed nothing

- **Method:** a pristine checkout of `b3af0ca` (a git worktree) against the lifted code. Same arms,
  same seeds, rows compared value by value with timings excluded (`cp1_repro.py`, session
  scratchpad).
- **ctl1** (n = 3, seed 7), **A3** (n = 4, seed 1; lens + clutter + noise, the whole fitter),
  **ctl2** (n = 4) and **ctl3a** (n = 1): **0 differing values.**
- **Fresh renders with the cache OFF** (no-lens/no-clutter and lens+clutter) are **bit-identical**
  to the cached ones.
  - This check matters because the render cache is keyed on scene settings, not code. The lifted
    `PHI` helper, used only by the renderer, was missing after the first rewire, and a cached run
    would not have noticed.
- **Arm P differs (445 values), and so does the PRISTINE code against itself.** Two pristine runs of
  the same P trials gave:
  - bitrates 18935.8 / 20483.3 kbps and then 18916.5 / 20145.2 kbps;
  - far-baseline L of 1.32 / 2.42 cm and then 0.58 / 2.97 cm.
- **FINDING: libx265 as CP1 drives it is not deterministic run to run on this machine**, most likely
  from encoder threading.
  - qa's "bit-identical reproduction" covered the codec-free controls only.
  - A single trial's far-baseline number carries up to ~0.7 cm of encoder noise.
  - CP1's p90 over 400 trials is a population figure and is not overturned by this, but stage 2
    should pin encoder threads (e.g. `pools=1:frame-threads=1`) before any arm-vs-arm comparison of
    codec arms.
- **Pinned by `tests/test_paintfit_lift.py`:** A3 trial 0 reproduces the pre-lift f, λ, height,
  κ, σ, per-line point counts and three line errors.
- **The CourtNet decode moved into `calibration.courtnet_decode`:** `detect_court_learned` returned
  identical keypoints, homography and confidence to the pristine code on two rendered courts, with
  `courtnet_split.pt`.

## What was NOT done, and why

- **No real footage was run.** This repository holds no video; the footage lives in the main
  repository's `data/incoming`, which this project's settings forbid reading (`Read(../**)`).
  `run.py`, `pipeline.py` and `schema.py` are not in the court-only repository, so there is no
  `analyze` to integrate the tracker into. The tracker is standalone.
- **`live.py` is not in this repository**, and the plan left it out anyway (queue item 4).
- **No detector was trained.** `CourtNetKeypoints` wraps the existing CourtNet, which on amateur
  footage fires on 2–3 of 14 keypoints (cnn-global-classical-local). A model trained on amateur or
  synthetic courts plugs in behind `KeypointDetector`; that is a separate, pre-registered ML task.
- **No ball code.** `CourtCamera.ray()` is the single-camera inverse projection a future solver
  would use; a ray pins nothing until something else does (rule 5).
- **Cost:** one paint fit is ~11 s on this CPU at 1080p, and the tracker re-fits at most every 10 s
  or on drift. Nothing here is measured on a phone.
