## TASK

CP1 stage 1 (whole-court line fit on rendered courts) passed in the main repository (frozen 4ac52fc, results 99e1812) and is included here; its independent qa audit was in progress when this repository was created.

## LOG
- CARRIED FORWARD: `python` broken Store shim -> backend/.venv/Scripts/python.exe
- CARRIED FORWARD: grep -rn at repo ROOT times out (walks .venv) - grep explicit dirs.
- CARRIED FORWARD: Grep/Glob TOOLS false "no matches" (T25); use bash grep.
- CARRIED FORWARD: long markdown via heredoc FAILS -> use Write tool for long docs.
- CARRIED FORWARD: bash /tmp not visible to Windows python.exe - use scratchpad abs path.
- CARRIED FORWARD: tools/ and ball_physics/ are at the REPO ROOT, not under backend/.
- CARRIED FORWARD: smoke-test at small n before any long run (float32 JSON crash, 25 min).
